    1. AAP, I want to see a welcome message at the start:
            ----------------------
            Let's play Py-Pac-Poe!
            ----------------------
    
    2. AAP, before being prompted for a move, I want to see the board printed out in the console, so that I know what moves have been made:
                A   B   C

            1)  X |   | O
            -----------
            2)    | X |
            -----------
            3)  X | O | O
    
    3. AAP, I want to be prompted with which player's move it is.
    
    4. AAP, I want to be prompted on how to enter a valid move so that I don't make mistakes:
                A   B   C

            1)  X |   | O
            -----------
            2)    | X |
            -----------
            3)  X | O | O

        Player X's Move (example B2):
    
    5. AAP, I want to be able to enter my move's column letter in upper or lower case (a/A, b/B, c/C) to make it easier to enter my move.
    
    6. AAP, if I enter a move in an invalid format, or if I try to occupy a cell already taken, I want to see a message chastising me and be re-prompted:
            Player X's Move (example B2): Z9
            Bogus move! Try again...

            Player X's Move (example B2):
    
    7. AAP, at the end of a game I want to see who won the game:
            Player X wins the game!
        or if it was a tie
            Another tie!
